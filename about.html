                <h1>Manx Biltong is Steven Brimelow’s Island Heritage in Every Slice</h1>
                <p>From South African roots to Isle of Man shores, Steven Brimelow blends tradition, quality, and community to craft biltong that honours both homelands.</p>

                    <h2>Island Pride Meets Family Tradition</h2>
                    <p>Steven Brimelow grew up in Johannesburg eating biltong on the go. Back in South Africa he spent weekends with his sons Oscar and Felix making their own batches and tinkering with homemade drying boxes as family side projects.</p>
                    <p>With more than twenty years of curing under his belt, Steven launched Manx Biltong after settling on the Isle of Man, still hand-trimming each cut, blending spices by feel, and drying in small batches.</p>
                    <p>Today, Manx Biltong supplies homes, local shops, and Isle of Man TT paddocks across the island, keeping things close to the community that helped it grow.</p>

                    <h2>Biltong Roots</h2>
                    <p>This was the early Manx Biltong setup Steven built after moving from South Africa. He now relies on an industrial dryer that handles up to 45 kilograms a run.</p>
                    <p>Steven still checks every batch by hand, trimming the silverskin and tasting a slice before sealing the packs. If you have questions about storing or pairing the Classic Manx Cut, he is only a call away and happy to share tips from more than twenty years of curing experience.</p>
                    <p>Get the taste of South Africa wherever you are on the island. Whether you need fuel for a Springbok rugby watch party or just a savoury snack at home, let Manx Biltong keep you going.</p>

                    <h2>Journalist Roots</h2>
                    <p>Before launching Manx Biltong, Steven Brimelow worked as a journalist all over Africa and even met Nelson Mandela. The curiosity and care he brought to storytelling now goes into every batch of biltong.</p>
                    <p>Those years on assignment taught Steven to listen closely, respect every story, and stay patient under pressure—all traits that show up in the way he cures beef and looks after his customers.</p>
